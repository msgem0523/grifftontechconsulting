# Griffton’s Tech Consulting 💻✨

Griffton’s Tech Consulting is a technology consulting venture focused on building clean, modern, and scalable digital solutions for individuals, small businesses, and growing brands.

This site serves as the official web presence for Griffton’s Tech Consulting and showcases services, branding, and future offerings.

## 🚀 Purpose

Our mission is to help clients:
- Establish a strong digital presence  
- Simplify technology decisions  
- Launch clean, functional, and user-friendly websites  
- Bridge the gap between ideas and execution  

We focus on **clarity, usability, and long-term growth**—not over-engineered fluff.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This website is built using:

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript  
- (Frameworks/libraries may be added as the project evolves)

The structure is intentionally lightweight and flexible to allow for future expansion.
